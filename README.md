# Hand-Written-Digit-Prediction
This project aims to recognize human handwritten digits using a deep learning model

I have used the MNIST dataset here
The MNIST database is a large database containing 60,000 training images of handwritten digits from zero to nine and 10,000 images for testing. 
The handwritten digits images are represented as a 28x28 matrix where each cell contains a grayscale pixel value.
